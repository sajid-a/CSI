            <h1><span>Networking Workshop</span></h1>
            <p>When we communicate with people, we address them using their names. For example, just the name Bill Gates, would give you a clear idea about the person. Even computers communicate in a similar way. Their names however are numeric, and are called IP addresses. An IP Address would look somewhat like this '192.168.1.15'.<br><br>
Each machine that wants to communicate must be connected to rest of the machines in some way. We call this a network. Each computer on a particular network should have a unique IP address otherwise it would be difficult to communicate. Imagine what would happen if there are two students in your class with the same first and last name. 
When your friend is sitting right next to you you can have a face to face communication. 
But if that is not the case then you would have to use means such as a cell phone or a PC.
It's the same with machines.Two machines should be on the same network if they want to communicate. When they are not on the same network they have to use a device such as a router or a switch. Such a device should also have a name (rather an IP address). In fact it would have more than one name: one for each network to which it is connected! This is similar to the situation where you may have a pet name at home but your friends recognize you by your actual name in college. This is the gateway address.<br><br>
So how do we know whether two machines are in network? Well every network also has an address called a network address. Note that this is not the address of any particular machine in the network. So, given the IP address of the two machines we can check whether they have the same network address. And for that we use the subnet mask. (Oversimplification of the concept!!).<br><br>
When we want to connect to google.com, we actually are connecting to a machine, in this case called the server. So even though we are not providing the IP address we are still connecting to the server, isn't it? You would infer that now there should be one more device thats sits somewhere in the internet to whom your computer actually asks "Dude!! Whats the IP address of google.com?" for which it replies "Well, it's 64.233.181.104 !".<br><br> 
This machine is called the DNS server. DNS stands for Domain Name Resolution.  Here google.com is the domain name which is resolved (or translated to the IP address of that domain).  As you would imagine this server actually maintains a table with one column "Domain name" and another "IP Address".
These terms mentioned above need to be told to your machine by some way :<br><br>
1. IP address of your machine<br>
2. Subnet mask of its network<br>
3. Gateway address<br>
4. Address of the DNS server<br><br>
These would be sufficient to get your PC on the net!<br><br>
